I lead the **opening shift**, ensuring the store is guest‑ready and safe. My focus is on **process discipline**, **clear delegation**, and a **welcoming front‑of‑house**.

**Responsibilities**
- Execute the opening checklist end‑to‑end and document completion.
- Verify **food safety**: labeling, storage, and temperature checks.
- Coordinate team setup by station to reduce last‑minute scrambling.
- Own the POS at open; handle payment issues and keep the line moving.
- Maintain presentation standards for subs and store appearance.

**Reflection on leadership**
- Effective shifts come from **clarity + calm**. I set expectations early and communicate changes.
- I model a **service‑first mindset** and appreciate teammates verbally during the rush.
