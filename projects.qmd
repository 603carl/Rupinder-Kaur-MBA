**Context.** Busy suburban location with high lunchtime traffic and strict opening SLAs.  
**Role.** Opening shift lead coordinating prep, food safety checks, and first-hour throughput.  
**Actions.**
- Executed **checklist-driven open**: equipment warm-up, line setup, ingredient temperature checks.
- **Delegated prep** by station; verified labeling and FIFO rotation.
- Oversaw **front counter & POS**, resolved order issues, and supported new team members.
- Ensured **presentation consistency** and store readiness before the first rush.

**Outcome.** Reliable open, fewer last-minute reworks, and smoother guest flow during peak hour.
