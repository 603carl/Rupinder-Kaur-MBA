# Appendix — LLM Site Map, Drafts, and Command Log

## A. Prompts & Model Drafts

**Prompt A1 (Planning):**  
“Use an LLM to brainstorm and outline a full MBA portfolio website with at least four pages (Home/About, Resume/CV, Projects/Case Studies, Skills & Certifications, Contact; optionally Leadership). Include brief bullet drafts for each.”

**Model Draft A1 (Excerpt):**
- **Home/About:** one‑paragraph intro, highlights, quick links buttons.
- **Resume:** summary, experience bullets, education, skills, download link to PDF.
- **Projects:** case cards with context → actions → outcomes; include Firehouse Subs leadership.
- **Skills & Certifications:** grouped by interpersonal vs. operations/tools.
- **Contact:** email, LinkedIn, mailto button.
- **Leadership (optional):** deeper write‑up of opening‑shift leadership with the provided photo.

**Edits Made:** Personalized tasks to match my real work; removed any invented metrics; added alt text and improved headings for accessibility; created a custom theme for visual polish.

## B. Section Drafts (Initial → Final)

- **Projects/Leadership:** Kept the CAO structure (Context, Actions, Outcome). Final text replaced generic terms with concrete steps (temperature checks, FIFO labeling, POS ownership).

- **Resume:** Converted duties into concise bullets and added a clear PDF download link.

- **Home:** Added a friendly hero section with buttons for quick navigation.

## E. Full LLM Planning → Drafting → Personalization Trail

Below are the **exact prompts** (abridged only for trivially repeated instructions) and **model responses** used to plan and scaffold the site. Each response was **reviewed and edited** to match real experience and course requirements.

### E1. Prompt — Site Map & Sections
> “Use an LLM to brainstorm and outline a full MBA portfolio website with at least four pages (Home/About, Resume/CV, Projects/Case Studies, Skills & Certifications, Contact; optionally Leadership). Include structured bullet drafts for each.”

**Model Response (kept):**
- Home/About: short intro, highlights, quick-link buttons.
- Resume: experience, education, skills, PDF download.
- Projects: CAO format (Context, Actions, Outcome); include Firehouse Subs leadership.
- Skills: Interpersonal vs. Operations/Tools; certifications.
- Contact: email, LinkedIn, mailto button.
- Leadership (optional): deeper narrative + provided photo.

**Edits applied:** Personalized bullets to real tasks, removed invented metrics, ensured alt text, created a gradient style and badges for visual polish.

### E2. Prompt — Homepage hero & visual style
> “Draft a concise homepage hero for an MBA student working as an opening shift lead; add quick links and suggest a modern but readable CSS style (buttons, cards, gradients).”

**Model Response (used and adapted):**
- Hero with headline + subtext, two CTAs (Resume, Projects).  
- Soft gradient background, rounded cards, pill badges.  
- *Edits:* Rewrote copy to reflect actual duties; ensured WCAG-friendly contrast and larger click targets.

### E3. Prompt — Leadership CAO case
> “Write a case entry using CAO format for leading the opening shift at a quick service restaurant.”

**Model Response (used and adapted):**
- Context: opening hour rush, strict SLAs.
- Actions: checklist open, delegation by station, labeling FIFO, POS ownership, presentation standard.
- Outcome: smoother open, fewer last-minute reworks, better guest flow.
- *Edits:* Removed generic claims; kept discrete actions only.

### E4. Prompt — Resume bullets
> “Summarize duties for opening shift lead (food handling, sanitation, POS, cash handling, training).”

**Model Response (used):** Converted into concise bullets; added education and a direct PDF download block.

### E5. Prompt — Accessibility checklist
> “List practical steps to make a simple Quarto site accessible for marking (alt text, headings, keyboard focus).”

**Model Response (integrated):** Alt text, heading hierarchy, link names (no ‘click here’), color contrast, focus indicators.

### E6. Prompt — GitHub Pages steps (Quarto)
> “Give exact commands to publish a Quarto website to GitHub Pages.”

**Model Response (kept verbatim in Section C & D):** `quarto render`, `quarto publish gh-pages`, and `quarto use gh-pages` flow.

**Annotation:** All LLM text was **reviewed for authenticity** and updated to reflect real experience; any generic or invented figures were removed. The final text is personal and accurate.
