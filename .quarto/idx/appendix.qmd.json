Full LLM Planning → Drafting → Personalization Trail\n\nBelow are the **exact prompts** (abridged only for trivially repeated instructions) and **model responses** used to plan and scaffold the site.

Prompt — Site Map & Sections\n> “Use an LLM to brainstorm and outline a full MBA portfolio website with at least four pages (Home/About, Resume/CV, Projects/Case Studies, Skills & Certifications, Contact; optionally Leadership). Include structured bullet drafts for each.”\n\n**Model Response (kept):**\n- Home/About: short intro, highlights, quick-link buttons.\n- Resume: experience, education, skills, PDF download.\n- Projects: CAO format (Context, Actions, Outcome); include Firehouse Subs leadership.\n- Skills: Interpersonal vs. Operations/Tools; certifications.\n- Contact: email, LinkedIn, mailto button.\n- Leadership (optional): deeper narrative + provided photo.\n\n**Edits applied:** Personalized bullets to real tasks, removed invented metrics, ensured alt text, created a gradient style and badges for visual polish.\n\n### E2. Prompt — Homepage hero & visual style\n> “Draft a concise homepage hero for an MBA student working as an opening shift lead; add quick links and suggest a modern but readable CSS style (buttons, cards, gradients).”\n\n**Model Response (used and adapted):**\n- Hero with headline + subtext, two CTAs (Resume, Projects).  \n- Soft gradient background, rounded cards, pill badges.  \n- *Edits:* Rewrote copy to reflect actual duties; ensured WCAG-friendly contrast and larger click targets.\n\n### E3. Prompt — Leadership CAO case\n> “Write a case entry using CAO format for leading the opening shift at a quick service restaurant.”\n\n**Model Response (used and adapted):**\n- Context: opening hour rush, strict SLAs.\n- Actions: checklist open, delegation by station, labeling FIFO, POS ownership, presentation standard.\n- Outcome: smoother open, fewer last-minute reworks, better guest flow.\n- *Edits:* Removed generic claims; kept discrete actions only.\n\n### E4. Prompt — Resume bullets\n> “Summarize duties for opening shift lead (food handling, sanitation, POS, cash handling, training).”\n\n**Model Response (used):** Converted into concise bullets; added education and a direct PDF download block.\n\n### E5. Prompt — Accessibility checklist\n> “List practical steps to make a simple Quarto site accessible for marking (alt text, headings, keyboard focus).”\n\n**Model Response (integrated):** Alt text, heading hierarchy, link names (no ‘click here’), color contrast, focus indicators.\n\n### E6. Prompt — GitHub Pages steps (Quarto)\n> “Give exact commands to publish a Quarto website to GitHub Pages.”\n\n**Model Response (kept verbatim in Section C & D):** `quarto render`, `quarto publish gh-pages`, and `quarto use gh-pages` flow.\n\n**Annotation:** All LLM text was **reviewed for authenticity** and updated to reflect real experience; any generic or invented figures were removed. The final text is personal and accurate.\n\n---\n\n## F. Rubric Trace (where each requirement is satisfied)\n\n- **Multi-page site with separate `.qmd` files:** `index.qmd`, `resume.qmd`, `projects.qmd`, `skills.qmd`, `leadership.qmd`, `contact.qmd`.\n- **Navigation configured:** `_quarto.yml` with right-aligned nav links; logo + brand on left.\n- **Visual elements:** Firehouse image; styled buttons/badges; alt text set.\n- **Resume download:** `assets/pdf/rupinder_kaur_resume.pdf` linked on Resume page.\n- **Reflection:** `Reflection.md` (300–500 words).\n- **Appendix with LLM drafts + commands:** this document (Sections A–F).\n- **Accessibility & usability:** checks noted above.\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Appendix — LLM Site Map, Drafts, and Command Log\n\n## A.
